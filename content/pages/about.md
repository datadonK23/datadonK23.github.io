# About Me
My name is Thomas and I'm a self-employed Data Scientist from Austria. My background is in Social Sciences (master's degree) and Geoinformatics (professional degree). Besides that, I deeply enjoy lifelong learning and therefore working through various books & courses in the domains of Data Science and Programming. Also, I participate in and contribute to open source communities regularly.

## Qualities
[UPenn's character strength survey](https://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu/) says:

1. Judgement
2. Love of Learning
3. Kindness

I consider myself as an open-minded person, a personal quality that helps to collect much of general knowledge. And I deeply enjoy beeing creative, but sadly haven't as often possibilities to live it up as I would like. Which is the main drawback of beeing highly structured in thinking and acting. But, enough vaunt for now.

## Bad Habits
* Caffeinated, too often.
* Lost in details, too much.
* Under tension, ever.
* Sarky, by nature.

## Leisure
In my spare time I love doing some [sport activities](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4964932) (esp. cycling and swimming) and enjoy going to Football.
