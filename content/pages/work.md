# Profession
I'm a self-employed Data Scientist (Type B). My professional focus is currently on advanced analytical problems, which can be solved by methods of Machine Learning, especially in the fields of language and text.

_Methods_:

* Data Analytics
* Statistical Modeling
* Data Visualization
* Machine Learning, including Deep Learning
* TrustworthyAI
* Natural Language Processing

## Toolbox
_Data Science_:

* PyData Stack (Anaconda, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, ...)
* spaCy, NLTK
* Elasticsearch, MongoDB, PostgreSQL/ PostGIS, SQLite
* Keras, TensorFlow, Transformers, MLflow
* QGIS, Folium
* Apache Spark

_Software Development_:

* Git
* Python, PyCharm
* Scala, Akka, SBT, IntelliJ
* Flask, Pelican, Node.js, JS, HTML, Bootstrap (all of them, only if necessary)
* Linux, Bash
* AWS, GCP, IBM Cloud
