# Profession
Actually I'm self-employed as a Data Science Freelancer. You can visit my (loosely updated) company site here: [daten sensorium](http://datensensorium.co.at/).

Coming from traditional data analytics, my professional focus is currently on advanced analytical problems, which can be solved by methods of Machine Learning. Especially in the field of Deep Learning I've now made my first steps and wanna further pursue a career. Besides that, I try to keep current with fast data processing technologies (mostly stream analytics).

_Methods_:

* Data Analytics
* Statistical Modeling
* Machine Learning, including Deep Learning
* Graph Analytics
* Data Visualization

## Toolbox
_Data Science_:

* PyData Stack (Anaconda, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, ...)
* Keras
* MongoDB, PostgreSQL/ PostGIS, SQLite
* QGIS
* Apache Spark

_Software Development_:

* Git
* Python, PyCharm
* Scala, Akka, SBT, IntelliJ
* Flask, Pelican, Node.js, JS, HTML, Bootstrap (all of them, only if necessary)
* Linux, Bash
* AWS, GCP, IBM Cloud

## Certificates and Achievements
Showcase of _certificates_, I collected during the last years (there are some more, >40):
