# Profession
Actually I'm self-employed as a Data Science Freelancer. You can visit my (loosely updated) company site here: [daten sensorium](http://datensensorium.co.at/).

Coming from traditional data analytics, my professional focus is currently on advanced analytical problems, which can be solved by methods of Machine Learning. Especially in the field of Deep Learning I've now made my first steps and wanna further pursue a career. Besides that, I try to keep current with fast data processing technologies (mostly stream analytics).

Methods:

* Data Analytics
* Graph Analytics
* Statistical Modeling
* Machine Learning, including Deep Learning
* Data Visualization

## Toolbox
_Data Science_:

* PyData Stack (Anaconda, Pandas, scikit-learn, ...)
* Keras
* MongoDB, PostgreSQL/ PostGIS, SQLite
* QGIS
* Apache Spark

_Dev_:

* Git
* Python
* Scala, SBT, IntelliJ
* Flask, Node.js
* JS, HTML, Bootstrap
* AWS, GCE, IBM Cloud

## Certificates and Achievments
Showcase of certificates, I collected during the last years (there are many more, ~X):

* Fixme
* Fixme

Recent achievments, I'm proud of:

* Completed [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) specialization
* Author on [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
* Contributor to [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Roadmap
Fixme



### Code Highlighting
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
