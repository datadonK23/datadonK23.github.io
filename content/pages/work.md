# Profession
Actually I'm self-employed as a Data Science Freelancer. You can visit my (loosely updated) company site here: [daten sensorium](http://datensensorium.co.at/).

Coming from traditional Data Analytics, my professional focus is currently on advanced analytical problems, which can be solved by methods of Machine Learning. Besides that, I try to keep current with fast data processing technologies (mostly Stream Analytics).

_Methods_:

* Data Analytics
* Statistical Modeling
* Data Visualization
* Graph Analytics
* Machine Learning, including Deep Learning
* Natural Language Processsing

## Toolbox
_Data Science_:

* PyData Stack (Anaconda, Jupyter, Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, ...)
* Keras
* MongoDB, PostgreSQL/ PostGIS, SQLite
* QGIS, Folium
* Apache Spark

_Software Development_:

* Git
* Python, PyCharm
* Scala, Akka, SBT, IntelliJ
* Flask, Pelican, Node.js, JS, HTML, Bootstrap (all of them, only if necessary)
* Linux, Bash
* AWS, GCP, IBM Cloud

## Certificates and Achievements
Showcase of _certificates_, I collected during the last years (there are some more, >40):

* [Deep Learning Specialization]({filename}/pdfs/certs/Cert_DeepLearningAI.pdf)
* [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization]({filename}/pdfs/certs/Cert_Maths4ML.pdf)
